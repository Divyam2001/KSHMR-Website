			KSHMR released "House Of Cards" on February 16, 2018 which features a return by singer Sidnie Tipton, who previously collaborated with the artist on "Wildcard". Lacking KSHMR's notable big room elements, the track is influenced by pop and acoustic components such as guitar riffs in the song's break. He also played the mainstage of Ultra Music Festival Miami with a set presenting new tracks and many of his well-known productions.
			KSHMR's first release of the year was a collaboration with Belgian DJ Yves V and American band Krewella titled "No Regrets". Released through Dharma on March 1, 2019, critics had favorably compared the track's chord patterns and drop to Alan Walker's signature sounds.On June 24, 2019, KSHMR announced the release of a new educational Dharma Worldwide platform consisting of tutorials, templates, and samples.
